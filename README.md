## Introduction 🌟

Welcome to my Data Science and Machine Learning portfolio! This repository showcases my participation in the JUMIA Sentiment Analysis Challenge, where I achieved a top 3 finish. In this challenge, I developed a model to determine the sentiment of customer reviews on JUMIA Tunisia.

## About the Challenge 🌐

This competition was a part of the #MLOlympiad, organized by Kaggle and sponsored by Google Developers. The task involved performing sentiment analysis on textual customer reviews to categorize them as positive, negative, or neutral.

### Challenge Details 📝

- **Goal**: Perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews and classify them into 'Positive,' 'Negative,' or 'Neutral.'
- **Dataset**: The training and test datasets were provided, containing customer reviews and their associated sentiments.
- **Evaluation**: The evaluation metric for this competition was [CategorizationAccuracy].

## Project Files 📂

Here are the key files related to this project:

- [**train.csv**](./train.csv) - The training dataset containing customer reviews and sentiment labels.
- [**test.csv**](./train.csv) - The test dataset for making predictions.
- [**sample_submission.csv**](./sample_submission.csv) - A sample submission file with the required format.
- [**notebook in Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/code/amirfares/jumiasentimentanalysis) or [**jumiasentimentanalysis.ipynb**](./jumiasentimentanalysis.ipynb) - My Jupyter Notebook with code, analysis, and model implementation.

## My Approach 🚀

1. **Data Exploration**: I began by exploring the training dataset to understand the data's characteristics and distribution.

2. **Feature Engineering**: I performed text preprocessing and feature engineering to prepare the data for modeling.

3. **Model Selection**: I experimented with various machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) models to determine the best-performing one.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: To optimize model performance, I fine-tuned hyperparameters.

5. **Validation**: I utilized cross-validation techniques to assess model accuracy and robustness.

6. **Submission**: After achieving satisfactory results, I created submission files for evaluation.

For a detailed implementation and analysis, please refer to my [jumiasentimentanalysis.ipynb](./jumiasentimentanalysis.ipynb).

## Results 📈

I'm delighted to announce that I secured a top 3 position in the ML Olympiad's JUMIA Sentiment Analysis Challenge. My model effectively classified customer reviews' sentiments, contributing to business insights and customer satisfaction.

## Future Steps 🌱

As I continue to advance my skills in data science and machine learning, my future plans for this project include:

- Exploring advanced NLP techniques to further enhance sentiment classification.
- Incorporating additional data sources to improve model accuracy.
- Enhancing model interpretability for practical applications.
